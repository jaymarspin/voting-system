# voting-system
voting system built on javafx,java, rest web services

use netbeans platform

if you want to import this in your project directories
make sure you reimport all the libraries needed in this project
located at /dist/lib
once youre done you'll still encounter error that says 
a library is not found or something like that
you'll need to remove the broken reference 
in the properties of the project 
search it on the internet if you find it hard to do


once youre done
you'll have to copy the votingServer folder and paste it inside
c:/xampp/htdocs
then you have to import the sql file
in localhost/phpmyadmin the name of the database should be voting no other than that

once you did all of that correctly then everything should run perfectly
